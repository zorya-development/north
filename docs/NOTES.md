# Pages to implement

1. Today page — actionable tasks grouped by project (server function + component)
2. Project page — list view with subtask expansion and inline edit
3. Tags REST endpoints — CRUD so they're usable from the UI
4. Global task creation modal — header "+" button
5. Review page UI — the API is already there
6. All Tasks page — flat filterable list
